Project Title: FOOD Calories Estimation

Objective : Is a calorie estimation tool of food items, which applies techniques of image recognition with machine 
            learning. It would assist users in conveniently tracking their dietary intake bye providing appropriate 
            calorie estimates based on food images.

R3 : Clustering
- Clustering algorithms are applied to group food items based on nutritional properties
  *Techniques Used:
            - K-Means Clustering: It clusters the data based on centroid-based optimization.
            Repository Location: https://github.com/Alfia2003/Dubai_PG9/blob/main/notebook/5.%20Kmeans%20(1).ipynb
            - Elbow Method: It decides the optimum number of clusters depending on the within-cluster variance.
            Repository Location: https://github.com/Alfia2003/Dubai_PG9/blob/main/notebook/03_Elbow_method.ipynb
            - Silhouette Analysis: This gives a cluster's quality based on the similarity of items within a cluster to others.

            - Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a tree-like structure(dendrogram) to show hierarchical relationships between items.

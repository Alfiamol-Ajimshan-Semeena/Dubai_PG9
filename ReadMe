Project Title: FOOD Calories Estimation

Objective : Is a calorie estimation tool of food items, which applies techniques of image recognition with machine 
            learning. It would assist users in conveniently tracking their dietary intake bye providing appropriate 
            calorie estimates based on food images.

Research Objectives
*Food Calorie Estimator: Design a system to accurately estimate food calorie content by employing image recognition
                         and machine learning techniques.
*Enhancing Dietary Tracking: Allow for efficient and easy dietary intake monitoring by users, taking advantage of 
                             both image and tabular datasets.
*Improve the Performance of Models: Train deep machine learning models, such as CNNs, on these bulk data to achieve
                                    the best classification accuracy and estimation of food items and their calorie counts.
